# Lung-Cancer-Prediction

End-to-end project that predicts lung-cancer risk (Low/Medium/High) from lifestyle & clinical factors.
Includes: data cleaning, label mapping, StandardScaler, permutation feature importance (top-10 features), Keras neural network (ReLU → Softmax, Adam, cross-entropy), accuracy evaluation, and a multi-page Streamlit UI that collects inputs and shows risk % with a pie chart plus “find a doctor” action.
Repo contents: app code, datasets (lung cancer data.csv + survey), saved models (my_model.h5, rf_lung_cancer_model.joblib, scaler.joblib), presentation deck, demo media, and the assignment report detailing methodology, results, challenges, and future work. See the PDF for full write up.
